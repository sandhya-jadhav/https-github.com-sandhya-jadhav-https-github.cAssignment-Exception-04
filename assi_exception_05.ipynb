    "#### Multiprocessing is a programming technique in Python that allows for parallel execution of tasks by utilizing multiple CPU cores. It involves creating and managing multiple processes, each with its own memory space, to perform tasks concurrently.\n",

    "#### Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In CPython, the GIL can limit the effectiveness of multithreading for CPU-bound tasks. Multiprocessing sidesteps this issue because each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, allowing true parallelism.\n",

    "#### Parallel Execution: Utilizes multiple CPU cores to perform computations or tasks simultaneously, improving overall performance for CPU-bound operations.\n",

    "#### Memory Isolation: Each process runs independently with its own memory space, avoiding issues like data corruption due to concurrent access.\n",

    "#### Concurrency vs. Parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiprocessing: Achieves parallelism by running multiple processes simultaneously on different CPU cores. Each process has its own memory space.\n",
    "#### Multithreading: Achieves concurrency by running multiple threads within the same process. Threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "#### Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiprocessing: Bypasses the GIL in CPython, allowing multiple processes to run in parallel on different CPU cores, effectively utilizing multiple cores for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "#### Multithreading: Limited by the GIL in CPython, which can prevent true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks. Threads are executed one at a time in the context of the GIL, though they can run concurrently for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "#### Memory Space:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiprocessing: Each process has its own independent memory space. This isolation avoids issues related to shared memory but requires inter-process communication (IPC) for data sharing.\n",
    " #### Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space of the parent process, which facilitates communication and data sharing but introduces risks like race conditions and synchronization issues.\n",
    "#### Overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiprocessing: Higher memory and resource overhead due to the creation of separate processes. Each process has its own memory and resources.\n",
    "#### Multithreading: Lower overhead compared to multiprocessing, as threads share the same memory space and resources of the parent process.\n",
    "#### Synchronization:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiprocessing: Requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like queues or pipes to share data between processes.\n",
    "#### Multithreading: Uses synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, or condition variables to manage access to shared resources.\n",
    "####Fault Isolation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiprocessing: Faults in one process do not affect other processes, providing better fault isolation.\n",
    "#### Multithreading: A fault or crash in one thread can potentially affect the entire process, since threads share the same memory space.\n"
